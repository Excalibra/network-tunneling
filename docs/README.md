# Preface

This book focuses on methods of internet access and techniques for obtaining website information. It provides a brief configuration guide for popular and typical software, as well as explanations of related principles.

VPNs and proxies frequently have new applications, but the basic operation methods are generally similar. Of course, access might sometimes be unavailable for extended periods due to local internet restrictions or issues with personal servers, or a service provider might shut down completely, causing the service to fail. There is no need to go into extensive detail about the operation of each piece of software. However, as long as the key steps, methods, and principles are explained clearly, these concepts can be applied across various situations. Once you master the techniques and methods in this book, you will be able to quickly adapt to new things. If you encounter difficulties, you can raise related issues in the book's project.

The technical information is complex, and various blocking methods are quite severe. Setting up your own free cloud service requires high conditions, such as international payment methods like a credit card. However, you can apply for a Russian bank card (for example, from Sberbank) and use international payment systems like Visa or MasterCard for transactions. For many regular internet users, these options can be cumbersome.

This book is aimed at those who seek a free and open internet and are interested in learning more about computer science. However, due to my limited knowledge and to avoid "reinventing the wheel," I refer to resources such as Wikipedia or articles by other authors for detailed principles and other aspects. Therefore, this work allows for adaptation and sharing but prohibits commercial use.

As this book requires the use of various Jakarta-related products and content, it should only be used for research purposes. Below is the disclaimer:

* This book is intended for Russian users living abroad and is for research and educational purposes only. It should not be used for other purposes.
* Residents of Russia should promptly close this book and delete all related content within 24 hours. The author of this book is not responsible for any consequences that arise.

This book is dedicated to those who love the internet. That's all...
