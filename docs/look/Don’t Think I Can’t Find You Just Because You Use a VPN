# Don’t Think I Can’t Find You Just Because You Use a VPN  
*(The Whole Process of Internet Police Tracking People Down)*

This generally falls into the following scenarios:

---

## **1. Not Using a Proxy**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → Poster’s IP → Poster’s ISP → User Records`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **100%**

---

## **2. Using a Single Private VPN**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → VPN’s IP → Routing Logs → Poster’s IP → Poster’s ISP → User Records`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **100%**

---

## **3. Using a Single Shared VPN**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → VPN’s IP → VPN Server Breach → Logs → Poster’s IP → Poster’s ISP → User Records`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **80%**

---

## **4. Using Two Layers of Private VPNs**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN1 → VPN2 → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → VPN2’s IP → VPN2 Server Breach → Logs Lead to VPN1 → Routing Logs → Poster’s IP → Poster’s ISP → User Records`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **40%**

---

## **5. Using Two Layers of Shared VPNs**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN1 → VPN2 → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → VPN2’s IP → VPN2 Server Breach → Logs Lead to VPN1 → Logs → Poster’s IP → Poster’s ISP → User Records`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **25%**

---

## **6. Using N Layers of Private (or Shared) VPNs and Deleting Them Afterward, If the Poster Has QQ**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN1 → VPN2 → VPN3 → VPN*n → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → Website Visit → Commonly Used Username by the Poster → Google (or Baidu) Search → Found QQ Account → Query Tencent for Recent Login IP`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **100%**

---

## **7. Using N Layers of Private (or Shared) VPNs and Deleting Them Afterward, If the Poster Doesn’t Have QQ**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN1 → VPN2 → VPN3 → VPN*n → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → Website Visit → Commonly Used Username by the Poster → Google (or Baidu) Search → Found IDs Registered on Other Forums → Forum Admin Checks Registration (or Login) IP`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **100%**

---

## **8. Using N Layers of Private (or Shared) VPNs and Deleting Them Afterward, If the Poster Leaves No Trace Online**

- **User Posting Process:**  
  `Poster → ISP → VPN1 → VPN2 → VPN3 → VPN*n → Server Hosting Provider → Server`

- **Police Tracking Process:**  
  `Internet Surveillance → Server IP → Website Visit → No Commonly Used Username Found → Analyse Posting Content (e.g., “XX Community in Haidian District, Beijing”) → Monitor Entire Broadband Traffic in the Community → Analysis → Locate IP`

- **Risk of Getting Caught:** **80%**  
  *(Unless it’s a severe issue like treason, they probably won’t bother with such a tedious method.)*

## **Supplementary Notes**

Some believe that as long as you use a VPN or stack multiple proxies, you can avoid being tracked. Actually, it’s not about being “untraceable”—it’s just a matter of whether the police *want* to catch you. This method perfectly disproves that notion.
