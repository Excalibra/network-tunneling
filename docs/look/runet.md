Monitoring Network Traffic:
- Roskomnadzor oversees all internet traffic, using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) technology implemented by ISPs to identify and filter unwanted content.
- If encrypted traffic patterns or VPN use are detected, Roskomnadzor may block access to VPN servers or demand logs from Russian-registered VPN services.

Responses and Actions:
1. **Weak Encryption Detection**: If weak encryption is used, Roskomnadzor can decrypt and inspect data, exposing user activities.
   - User is unaware of monitoring.

2. **Logged VPN Servers**: If the VPN server is a registered entity in Russia, it is required by law to store and share user data upon request.
   - High risk of exposure for users relying on domestic services.

3. **Unregistered VPN or Proxy**: Unregistered services are often blacklisted, cutting off access to users within Russia.

Escalation:
- For anonymous users, Roskomnadzor may correlate usage patterns and identifiers (e.g., usernames) with known accounts (social media, forums).
- Advanced tracking could include analyzing content (e.g., posts mentioning specific locations) and cross-referencing IP data from ISPs.

Runet:
- **Runet** represents the Russian segment of the internet, designed to ensure sovereignty by isolating it from the global web.
   - Features include national DNS systems and full routing control within Russia's borders.
   - Enables the state to restrict external internet services when necessary.

SORM:
- **System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM)** is Russia's mandatory surveillance system:
   - Requires ISPs and telecom providers to install equipment giving direct access to security agencies.
   - Focuses on interception for law enforcement rather than content filtering.
